**Key Changes:**

#### Service Providers
Laravel 11 streamlines service providers:
- Many are now automatically discovered
- Check `config/app.php` for any custom providers

2. **Database Changes**:
   - Some Eloquent methods have updated signatures
   - Check your models for deprecated methods

3. **Testing Updates**:
   - PHPUnit updated to ^11.0.1
   - Some test assertion methods may have changed

4. **Sanctum**: Updated to ^4.0 (authentication tokens)

### Step 5: Verification Commands

# Check Laravel version
php artisan --version

# Check for any configuration issues
php artisan config:cache
